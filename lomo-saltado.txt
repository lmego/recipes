 Ingredients
  - 1 lb sirloin steak cut in thin slices Save $
  - 2 garlic cloves
  - Minced Salt
  - Pepper to taste
  - 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
  - 1 small red onion cut in thick slices

Directions:
 1. Season the beef with garlic, salt and pepper.

 2. Put a wok or a pan over very high heat. Stir in oil and cook the meat, a few slices at a 
   time (so they do not steam and the meat browns). Cook each batch 2 minutes.

 3. Stir in the onion, tomato, chili pepper, and stir for about 2 to 3 minutes. The tomatoes 
   and onions should be crunchy, not mushy. Stir in soy sauce and vinegar on sides of wok or pan. 
   Mix everything. Add beef broth and cook 1-1/2 minutes. Taste for seasoning.

 4. Turn off the heat, add chopped cilantro and serve at once with French fries and white rice.
